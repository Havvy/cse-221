This is entirely for CSE 221 Data Structures at Clark College.

Unless you are another student or the teacher of the class, 
you should ignore this.

The top level folder (/) contains the following folders:

	jslibs: The Windows/Wine only runtime environment for this code.
	data: Holds the data we read in the programs.
The folder called common holds a bunch of common functions and
	doc: Holds documentation.
	code: Holds all of our code. Contains the
	following subfolders:

		prog:  Programs are in here.
		common:  An ad-hoc library.
		test: The tests for the various objects
		obj: The data-structures themselves are stored here.

		Also in the code folder is main.js. It is a shell from which you can 
		access the rest of the files. See /doc/main.txt for more.

To open the 'main shell', go to /jslibs and use 'jshost ../code/main.js'. The
rest of the commands are input to the main shell.
