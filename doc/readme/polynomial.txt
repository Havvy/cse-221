As always, a Windows environment is needed.

Open up the main shell as per the project README (above), and type 'shell poly' to get into
the Polynomial shell.

Files (all in code folder):
obj/Polynomial.js
test/PolynomialTest.js  << run with 'run test/PolynomialTest' or 'test Polynomial'
	This test case doesn't use our testing framework...
prog/shell/poly.js

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication work.  Division & Modulus do not.

The shell is crude in that if you type in something in non-polynomial style, it'll add
undefined data to the stack...
